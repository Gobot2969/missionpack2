# Quake III Ultimate Arena

Mod based off of Kr3m's missionpack plus with QL features, gametypes, and more!
 
**This is not a replacement for Team Arena! TA maps and virtually all their textures aren't included, meaning you'd still have to legally purchase Team Arena in order to enjoy all of its maps, along with most custom ones designed for TA!**

## Installation
 1. Download the release from the side
 2. Extract the ```missionpack2``` folder into your Quake 3 install folder. The ```missionpack2``` folder should be same folder as ```quake3.exe``` file and ```baseq3``` folder.
 3. Ensure directory looks as follows:
 ```
|-C:\Program Files {x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Quake 3 Arena\ (or something)
   |-quake3.exe
   |-baseq3\
      |-pak0.pk3
      |-...
   |-missionpack2\
      |-pakXX.pk3
      |-...
 ```

## Launching
#### Windows
 - Inside the ```missionpack2``` folder, run ```missionpack2.bat```. If you installed correctly off of CD, Steam, or GOG retail copies, the game should launch.

### Flagged cvars

The following cvars use a "bit flag" value which acts as a combination of integers to specify a group of items:

#### New in Ultimate Arena
* ```arenaWpflags <VAL>``` : defaults to ```2175```.  Starting weapons in loudouts for Arena / Team Arena gametypes. Default value of ```2175``` is QL CA loadout. See ```wpflags``` for weapon bits. A zero value means no change (spawn with Gauntlet and MG).

#### From Kr3m's missionpackplus
* ```wpflags <VAL>``` : defaults to ```0```. what weapons a player should have at spawn. A zero value means no change (spawn with Gauntlet and MG).
  
The corresponding bits for ```VAL``` are:

* Machinegun	```1```
* Shotgun	```2```
* Grenade Launcher	```4```
* Rocket Launcher	```8```
* Lightning Gun	```16```
* Railgun	```32```
* Plasma Gun	```64```
* BFG10K	```128```
* Nailgun ```256```
* Prox Launcher ```512```
* Chaingun ```1024```
* HMG ```2048``` *Ultimate Arena Only*

So, in order to let a player starts with a shotgun, a grenade launcher and a rocket launcher you can use "wpflags 14" (for 14 is 2+4+8). Note that players always start with the machinegun and the gauntlet.

The **removeX** cvars allow to choose to remove items from a map, **X** is either **ammo**, **item**, **powerup** or **weapon**:

* ```removeammo <VAL>``` use the same numbers as wpflags but for the corresponding ammunition
* ```removeeapon <VAL>``` use the same numbers as wpflags
* ```removeitem <VAL>```, where VAL can used the following values:
  * item_armor_shard ```1```
  * item_armor_combat ```2```
  * item_armor_body ```4```
  * item_health_small ```8```
  * item_health ```16```
  * item_health_large ```32```
  * item_health_mega ```64```
  * holdable_teleporter ```128```
  * holdable_medkit ```256```
  * holdable_kamikaze ```512``` *Team Arena Only*
  * holdable_portal ```1024``` *Team Arena Only*
  * holdable_invulnerability ```2048``` *-DMISSIONPACK Only*
  * armor_jacket ```4096``` *Ultimate Arena Only*
 * removepowerup "VAL", where VAL can used the following values:
   * item_quad ```1```
   * item_enviro ```2```
   * item_haste ```4```
   * item_invis ```8```
   * item_regen ```16```
   * item_flight ```32```

## Build Instructions
The build system included should be completely portable provided that you are on Windows (with Powershell for final pk3 zipping command).
1. Download the repository in zip file
2. Make a gamedir folder in the root of your Quake 3/ioquake3 install called `missionpack2`
3. Extract the *contents* of the repository folder into `missionpack2`
4. Navigate to `missionpack2\src`
5. Run `make.bat` -- this will compile all 3 QVM modules with `-DMISSIONPACK` and `-DMISSIONPACK2`, copy assets and create core/map .pk3 files ready to go
6. Use the `missionpack2.bat` file in its place to run. Alternatively, as always, you can start the mod with any engine of your choice:
  `<ENGINE_BINARY>.exe +set fs_game missionpack2`
7. FIGHT!
